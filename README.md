## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

The DC metro is one of the best metro systems in the US, with a simple map, clean trains and stations, ever evolving lines and more.  On my trip to Washington DC in 2019, just before COVID-19 caused chaios in the world, I had the amazing opportunity to experience riding the metro for myself.  The stations are lively and full of clean and simple yet a bit outdated architecture.  Each station has its own little touch, with the main material being concrete throughout the system.  This project aims to let any user use the mod and create their own amazing versions or re-creations of the DC metro inside of Minecraft, with the help of Jonafanho's MTR mod.  More information about the mod can be see on the curseforge, GitHub, or Discord.

## Disclaimer

**This mod is best used with the WMATA 7000 series addon pack, this can be found in the Discord under the extra content channel.

You may use any train you would like, but the WMATA 7000 series is an addon only, and is not part of the core mod!**
